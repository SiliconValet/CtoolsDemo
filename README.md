CtoolsDemo
==========

CTools content type demo code used for a MediaCurrent webinar

Module includes three punny and panefully named content types
 * paneless - Simple 'blocks in panels' type 
 * growing_panes - Added context requirement, conditional display of configurable content. 
 * t_pane - Modulates output of fields attached to entities and displayed in panels. 

growing_panes relies on the existence of a field attached to a content type of type "cog" and must 
therefore be modified for use elsewhere.
